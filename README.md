## 🤖 PoLMs for Fine-Tuning  

Fine-tuning constitutes a cornerstone of adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks, refining their capabilities through targeted parameter adjustments. This process leverages labeled or task-specific datasets to optimize performance, bridging the gap between general-purpose pre-training and domain-specific requirements. This chapter explores three principal fine-tuning paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning, which employs annotated datasets to enhance task-specific accuracy; Adaptive Fine-Tuning, which customizes model behavior via instruction tuning and prompt-based methods; and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, which integrates reinforcement learning to iteratively refine outputs based on reward signals, fostering continuous improvement through dynamic interaction.

## 🏆 PoLMs for Alignment

Alignment in LLMs involves guiding model outputs to conform to human expectations and preferences, particularly in safety-critical or user-facing applications. This chapter discusses three major paradigms for achieving alignment: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, which employs human-labeled data as a reward signal; Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback, which leverages AI-generated feedback to address scalability issues; and Direct Preference Optimization, which learns directly from pairwise human preference data without requiring an explicit reward model. Each paradigm offers distinct advantages, challenges, and trade-offs in its pursuit of robust alignment. A concise comparison of these and related methods is summarized in paper Table2.

## 🚀 PoLMs for Reasoning
Reasoning constitutes a central pillar for enabling LLMs to tackle tasks involving multi-step logic, intricate inference, and complex decision-making. This chapter examines two core techniques for enhancing model reasoning capabilities: Self-Refine for Reasoning, which guides the model to autonomously detect and remedy errors in its own reasoning steps; and Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning, which employs reward-based optimization to improve the consistency and depth of the model’s chain-of-thought. These approaches collectively enable more robust handling of long-horizon decision-making, logical proofs, mathematical reasoning, and other challenging tasks.

## 🧠 PoLMs for Efficiency
Building on the post-training optimization techniques discussed in earlier chapters, post-training efficiency specifically targets the operational performance of LLMs after their initial pre-training. The principal goal is to optimize key deployment metrics (e.g., processing speed, memory usage, and resource consumption), thereby making LLMs more practical for real-world applications. Approaches to achieving post-training efficiency fall into three main categories: Model Compression, which reduces the overall computational footprint through techniques such as pruning and quantization; Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, which updates only a fraction of a model’s parameters or employs specialized modules, thus minimizing retraining costs and accelerating adaptation to new tasks; and Knowledge Distillation, which transfers the knowledge from a larger, pre-trained model to a smaller model, enabling the smaller model to achieve comparable performance with reduced resource demands.

## 🌀 PoLMs for Integration and Adaptation
Integration and adaptation techniques are pivotal for enhancing the versatility and efficacy of LLMs across diverse real-world applications. These methodologies enable LLMs to seamlessly process heterogeneous data types, adapt to specialized domains, and leverage multiple architectural strengths, thereby addressing complex, multifaceted challenges. This chapter delineates three principal strategies: Multi-modal Integration, which equips models to handle diverse data modalities such as text, images, and audio; Domain Adaptation, which refines models for specific industries or use cases; and Model Merging, which amalgamates capabilities from distinct models to optimize overall performance. Collectively, these approaches enhance LLMs’ adaptability, efficiency, and robustness, broadening their applicability across varied tasks and contexts.

## 🤝 Datasets 
Post-training techniques are meticulously engineered to refine the adaptability of LLMs to specialized domains or tasks, leveraging datasets as the cornerstone of this optimization process. A thorough examination of prior researc underscores that the quality, diversity, and relevance of data profoundly influence model efficacy, often determining the success of post-training endeavors. To elucidate the critical role of datasets in this context, we present a comprehensive review and in-depth analysis of those employed in post-training phases, categorizing them into three principal types based on their collection methodologies: human-labeled data, distilled data, and synthetic data. These categories reflect distinct strategies in data curation, with models adopting either a singular approach or a hybrid methodology integrating multiple types to balance scalability, cost, and performance.  Paper Tab.9 provides a detailed overview of these dataset types, encompassing their origins, sizes, languages, tasks, and post-training phases (e.g., SFT and RLHF), which we explore in subsequent sections to highlight their contributions and challenges in advancing LLM capabilities.

## 📚  Applications

Despite the robust foundational capabilities imparted by pre-training, Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently encounter persistent limitations when deployed in specialized domains, including constrained context lengths, tendencies toward hallucination, suboptimal reasoning proficiency, and ingrained biases. These shortcomings assume critical significance in real-world applications, where precision, reliability, and ethical alignment are paramount. Such challenges prompt fundamental inquiries: (1) How can LLM performance be systematically enhanced to meet domain-specific demands? (2) What strategies can effectively mitigate the practical obstacles inherent in applied settings? Post-training emerges as a pivotal solution, augmenting LLMs’ adaptability by refining their recognition of domain-specific terminology and reasoning patterns while preserving their broad-spectrum competencies. This chapter delineates the transformative applications of post-trained LLMs across professional, technical, and interactive domains, elucidating how tailored post-training methodologies address these challenges and elevate model utility in diverse contexts.
